FallEngine, a C++17, header-only, engine for the Venezuelan "Ca√≠da" game.

Game instructions (WIP) are in `doc/caida_game.txt`.

Main executable is used for interactive testing, available commands are in `doc/commands.txt` (may make this some kind of interface for all implementers of this library, not sure if it'll work).

Tests use the Catch2 library.
